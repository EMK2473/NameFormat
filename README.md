## Description
OOP Lab Module: A Java program that formats a user's full name by displaying the last name first, followed by initials of the first and middle names.

## Installation Requirements
Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download it from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or use a package manager like Homebrew for macOS or apt-get for Linux. 

- Clone or download the repository: 
```Java 
- git clone https://github.com/your-username/NameFormat.git 
```

- Navigate to the project directory: 
```Java
- cd NameFormat 
```
- Compile the NameFormat.java file: 
```Java
- javac NameFormat.java 
```
- Run the program: 
```Java
- java NameFormat
```

## Application Usage
Once the program is running, it will prompt you to input your full name. The program will split the name and format it to display the last name first, followed by initials of the first and middle names.  

Example: If you input:  
```Java
John Michael Doe
``` 
The output will be:  
```Java
Doe, J.M.
```
